These old friends, together with our old memories with them, they are the reason why and where we are right now. So! Story time, I‚Äôve had an old friend whom helped me pass during my Grade School days. But eventually, there was time that we‚Äôve had to be separated because my family had to move to another city. We haven‚Äôt forgotten each other, in fact we often see each other‚Äôs posts in Facebook because we‚Äôre friends, but, we do not really interact with each other, we just know what happens. Here‚Äôs the ‚Äúexciting‚Äù part. Campaign period for Philippines 2022 National Elections have officially started, surprise surprise, most of them are Kakampink. How did I know you ask? Well Facebook, for some reason, decided that I should see my old friends post again because they are kakampinks. If my memory serves me right, I started to see their post when Pasiglaban (Election Campaign of VP Leni Robredo in Emerald Ave. , Pasig City to be President) campaign took place. And since then, I‚Äôve been interacting with them through comments on their shared post. I could‚Äôve shared posts too but oh well, I have soooo many BBM supporter relatives so I just didn‚Äôt. "

    "title": "My Coming Out Story",
    "body": "2022/04/27 - It has been 3-4 years since I discovered I was gay, it was a really hard time for me, but I think I‚Äôm ready to tell my story: I still remember before starting Grade 10, I prayed to God, hoping that no one would bully me anymore and that I‚Äôll have more friends this time around. (I was bullied for a lot of reasons back in Grade 6 to 9, and added the factor that I didn‚Äôt had a lot of friends because I was super shy and don‚Äôt know how to talk. It was terrible basically) My wish came true and I was super grateful, then with this new friend group I met a guy. He‚Äôs a really funny one, he would always make us laugh but specially me, his jokes, because of that I think out of all people we‚Äôve been the most closest. I would describe him as my best friend at the time to be honest. Then one day he told me he‚Äôs got crush on a girl, someone that is out of our circle but pretty close to us. He was rejected and I don‚Äôt blame the girl because she‚Äôs pretty much the aral muna type of person. This is when my best friend started to be sad, really really sad, not just because of the rejection but also some family issues that affected him. I stayed beside him, but most specially when he told me that he could possibly have a mental disorder that greatly affected his mood. I remember searching up articles on how to help someone with this. I was there when he needed someone to talk to, be it in chat, the class or even outside the class. Still remember that special moment when we sat on the side of a bridge, him telling his problems about his mom and just really really sad stuff. I was there through most of it, specially when he tried hurting himself, talking about suicide because he can‚Äôt bear it anymore. I begged him not to do it during the several times that he wanted to. Then one day one girl came to our lives, she‚Äôs not in our inner circle as well but she‚Äôs close to some of us. Soon, she and my best friend started to hangout more often. His mood definitely improved since they started to hangout and I don‚Äôt know why. I also felt at the time that I was being jealous at how they‚Äôre close. That feeling that you‚Äôre not needed anymore and that you should probably just let them be because that is the best for them, most specially for him. But I couldn‚Äôt keep those feelings and I think I admitted that I like him, or I was gay. It didn‚Äôt ended so well and we weren‚Äôt that close anymore after that. I don‚Äôt blame him, it must have been stressful for him already because of his problems, and me admitting must have caused him more. I think the most traumatic part of it is that I blamed myself why our friend group broke, even till this day. It was never been the same since. That I ended up loosing the friends I longed for, just because of my realization of my feelings for a guy. But what I didn‚Äôt blamed myself for is that I was there for someone when they really needed it. At that time my painful memories of being bullied was still there and feeling alone. And I don‚Äôt want that to happen to anyone else, most specially to the person that I like. I think that is my definition of love at the time, let go the person you love the most if it means that they would be better, without you. "

It mainly targets those who want to make a python chat bot that speaks exactly like the characters from the Visual Novel. Extracting Assets Tab: The GUI doesn‚Äôt become unresponsive thanks to perform_long_operation. And the write_event_value made it easy to pass the current file that is being extracted, as well as the current progress of the extraction from a separate python program Though I kinda wish this also works in the QT port as I prefer the look of that instead of Tkinter. But this will do for now! Extracting Scripts Tab: The layout tools worked very well in keeping the check boxes organized About Window: I really like the About window of GNOME / GTK apps so I made mine look similar to it The Github Repo link is here for anyone who wants to look at the code, warning it‚Äôs spaghetti code:https://github. com/lonewanderer27/Camp-Buddy-Toolbox And I am legally required to disclose the code anyway since I used and modified (a bit) the code of the extractor program (which is GPL-3 licensed) "

    "body": "2018/06/12 - There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor. If you‚Äôve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown! As with the last post about the editor, you‚Äôll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we‚Äôre using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: 123. my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}HTML: 12345&lt;li class= ml-1 mr-1 &gt;  &lt;a target= _blank  href= # &gt;  &lt;i class= fab fa-twitter &gt;&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;CSS: 12345678. highlight . c {  color: #999988;  font-style: italic; }. highlight . err {  color: #a61717;  background-color: #e3d2d2; }JS: 123456789// alertbar later$(document). scroll(function () {  var y = $(this). scrollTop();  if (y &gt; 280) {    $('. alertbar'). fadeIn();  } else {    $('. alertbar'). fadeOut();  }});Python: 1print( Hello World )Ruby: 123require 'redcarpet'markdown = Redcarpet. new( Hello World! )puts markdown. to_htmlC: 1printf( Hello World ); Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you‚Äôre never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits!

    "body": "2018/06/12 - The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their ‚ÄúDoll Series‚Äù, a set of five ‚Äúdie-cut‚Äù books, known also as shape books ‚Äî the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such ‚Äúbooks in the shape of a regular paper Doll‚Ä¶ originated with us‚Äù.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can‚Äôt find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children‚Äôs publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer‚Äôs ambitious Tree of Codes. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault‚Äôs classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one‚Äôs mother.

    "body": "2018/06/12 - There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor If you‚Äôve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown! As with the last post about the editor, you‚Äôll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we‚Äôre using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: 123. my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you‚Äôre never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here‚Äôs a standard YouTube embed code as an example: "

    "body": "2018/05/12 - gem install bundler installs the bundler gem through RubyGems. You only need to install it once - not every time you create a new Jekyll project. Here are some additional details: bundler is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires. The Gemfile and Gemfile. lock files inform Bundler about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn‚Äôt have these Gemfiles, you can omit bundle exec and just run jekyll serve. When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts. For more information about how to use Bundler in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly. "

    "body": "2018/01/12 - As I engage in the so-called ‚Äúbull sessions‚Äù around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the ‚Äúbrethren‚Äù think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one‚Äôs self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character‚Äìthat is the goal of true education.

From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them. So begins Hallam Hawksworth‚Äôs The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It‚Äôs a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don‚Äôt want you to think that I‚Äôm boasting, but I do believe I‚Äôm one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I‚Äôd like to hear about it. Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children‚Äôs classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.

    "body": "2018/01/11 - Director Roland Suso Richter‚Äôs enigmatic psychological thriller (direct to video/DVD) was based upon screenwriter Michael Cooney‚Äôs own play ‚ÄúPoint of Death‚Äù - a title that gave away the film‚Äôs entire plot twist premise. As in many similar films, such as Jacob‚Äôs Ladder (1990), Soul Survivors (2001), and The Butterfly Effect (2004), events and people were thoroughly distorted and confused because the protagonist was at the point of death. The tagline was misleading: ‚ÄúWhen You Don‚Äôt Have a Memory, How Can You Remember Who to Trust?‚Äù The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident ‚Äì but he had been revived (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre as good as new‚Äù). Dr. Newman: ‚ÄúSimon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002. And your wife, whose name is Anna, is waiting outside. ‚Äù (The doctor left off four crucial additional words, revealed in the film‚Äôs ending. ) (Spoiler: Simon had died and was not resuscitated!). A major clue to everything that truly happened was the scene that played next under the credits - hospital staff failed to bring a patient back to life with a defibrillator after a car accident. Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies. Now, there‚Äôs a mystery worth solving. Probably the biggest mystery there is. So how do we do spoilers?: 1&lt;span class= spoiler &gt;My hidden paragraph here. &lt;/span&gt;"

    "body": "2017/06/15 - 1. Andy Rubin: He because he is the main founder of Android. Which Google bought $50 Million dollars. I‚Äôve added him because without him, Android couldn‚Äôt have been existed, there will be no modders and developers like me creating Android forks. 2. Bill Gates: Bill Gates co ‚Äì founded with Paul Allen. They founded Microsoft which made Windows. FYI, Windows is the most dominant in computer operating system for PC followed by Apple Mac OS then Linux. At first Windows was just color based but now, it was the best Windows 10 ever, combined the Live Tile (Windows 8) and the revival of Start Menu style. (Windows 7) 3. Chainfire: I think that is not his real name. Consider him as the founder of modding in Android. Back in Android as early as Cupcake 1. 5. He is able to crack Android code, and able to install root access. Since then many modders followed what Chainfire started. Still, this time, he is working on FlashFire(On device flashing app) and in root fix in Google Pixel. Lately he developed systemless root for Android 6. 0 following Touchwiz 5. 1. 1. Then Nougat. 4. Rocky Gathercole: He was just a simple girlish boy. Back then he didn‚Äôt actually think to be a designer but later on in his life, a filipino designer meet up with him and he suggested to Rocky to became as a designer. His life wasn‚Äôt a glorious in the start but slowly he became famous and started to design some hollywood artists their gown or suite. Perfect example of ‚ÄúSome People Achieve Greatness‚Äù. 5. Steve Jobs: Believe it or not, i do not actually idolize Apple at first. But now im amazed what Apple has done in making iOS buttery smooth. It‚Äôs Steve Jobs who is the father of where is Apple right now. But sadly he is dead already. 6. Hershey Hilado: Her life wasn‚Äôt very easy. She is not born with golden spoon on her mouth. Her parents were not easy on her, here parents forcefully married her to a Korean man in exchange for money. But managed to escape to Manila and eventually found by his father relatives, there via laptop of her aunt, she met an Australian man, and the man fetched Hershey from Philippines. She thought that her life is going to perfect this time but not. And eventually broke up with his fiance and she build her own business but it got roughs so she switched to an online store. There, she eventually she got famous after a celebrity noticed her clothes she sells. 7. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte: Well after many years of waiting. There he comes, our new great president. Even i didn‚Äôt remember what all he had promised, i feel that everything is slowly but surely going up specially in our economy, add to that, i feel much safer now because of his campaign against illegal drugs. 8. John Wu: The creator of the most popular Magisk. The universal systemless interface. I can‚Äôt find his picture though. Magisk is a tool in Android devices that is used to root a device systemlessly, it doesn‚Äôt modify any system files thus bypassing SafetyNet which is developed by Google. Thanks to several contributors to android. John Wu came up with this tool. Lives in Taiwan. He is very friendly, (But almost developers and modders from XDA do) actually he provided a help (full documentation) to those who want to work this mod with their device. 9. Pent: Who created the most powerful automation app on android. Still, this day, I can‚Äôt get his pic. Tasker is in which you can create profiles that can automate several things like moving files at a certain time or answer a phone call when you are in home. But it‚Äôs pretty complicated specially for begginers as mostly it depends on global variables. He is friendly just like John Wu, and even for begginers, he advises them what to do and how to do it in Tasker. 10. Jamie: He created MacroDroid, an automation app but much easier to understand for begginers. MacroDroid provides a simple user interface, you got set: trigger, an action and an optional constraint, compare to complicated UI of Tasker Just like the first two, he is also friendly. He responds to those who post andasking for help in our forum for that app. He also takes feature request. And guess what, he is an Indi Developer which means,he is the only one who‚Äôs working on MacroDroid. "
